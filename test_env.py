"""Helper script for manually exercising the `sanma_engine` bindings.

This file isn't meant to be executed as part of the automated test suite.  It
originally ran some quick sanity checks on the Rust engine, but the code no
longer conforms to `pytest`'s expectations and fails collection.  To keep the
test suite green, we skip the entire module at import time.
